# AI Explorations (aiexplorations)

Welcome!  
This GitHub profile is the home of my open-source experiments and research projects around agentic AI, machine learning, search and information retrieval, and emergent dynamics in large language models.

## 👤 About Me

I'm an AI and machine learning engineering professional with around 10 years of experience in AI, and around 20 years of experience overall. The first decade of my career was built around the manufacturing industry, where I worked in automotive, trucks, fluid machinery and aerospace. My deep interest in statistics and ML took me to a career in data science. I've consulted with >100 clients over the last decade, and also built credible SaaS products for two product/platform companies. I'm a builder, tinkerer and engineer at heart, and love learning new things and solving problems.

This Github account helps me keep track of the hundreds of projects I've worked on in a personal capacity and does not include the work projects I work on.

About my personal projects and contributions here on Github:

- **Principal Research Focus:** Multi-agent systems, mathematical foundations of AI, graphs, dynamical systems, and interpretable machine learning.
- I love building small, testable research codebases that bridge mathematical foundations to hands-on implementations—especially if it's agentic, compositional, or reveals deep or interesting dynamics.
- My background: AI, math, distributed systems, software engineering, mechanical engineering, aerospace, quality management, systems engineering and optimization.
- Work includes automotive, aerospace, telecom, renewables, and most recently SaaS (data/MLOps platforms and HR platforms).

## 🚀 Featured Projects

- **🤖 Praval — Multi-Agent AI Framework**  
  Pythonic framework for building collaborative multi-agent systems. Compose simple agents for emergent capability, with built-in conversation memory, inter-process protocol (“Spore”), and LLM orchestration.
  - 📦 PyPI: [`praval`](https://pypi.org/project/praval/)
  - 💻 [Repo](https://github.com/aiexplorations/praval)
  - 📝 [Blog: Praval Agentic AI Framework](https://www.rajeshrs.in/blog/ai-explorations/2025-11-14-praval-agentic-ai-framework)

<!-- and so on for other projects, as above... -->

## 🛠️ How I Work

- Most projects are Python-first (with some TypeScript, Shell, and TeX/Markdown documentation).
- I organize repos by research question and strive for well-tested, simple, and reproducible codebases.
- Contributions are welcome—please open issues or discussions before PRs.
