# AI Explorations

Open-source research and tools at the intersection of multi-agent systems, mathematical foundations of AI, and interpretable machine learning.

## About

I'm Rajesh, an AI/ML engineering professional with ~10 years in AI and ~20 years overall. My first decade was in manufacturing (automotive, aerospace, fluid machinery), and my deep interest in statistics and ML led me to data science. I've consulted with 100+ clients and built SaaS products for data/MLOps and HR platforms.

**Research Focus:** Multi-agent systems, mathematical foundations of AI (dynamical systems, topology, category theory), and interpretable machine learning.

## Flagship Projects

### Praval — Multi-Agent AI Framework

Pythonic framework for building collaborative multi-agent systems. Agents coordinate through message passing via a shared "reef" (message bus), with no central orchestrator needed.

- **PyPI:** [`pip install praval`](https://pypi.org/project/praval/)
- **Website:** [pravalagents.com](https://pravalagents.com)
- **Repo:** [github.com/aiexplorations/praval](https://github.com/aiexplorations/praval)
- **Blog:** [Praval Agentic AI Framework](https://www.rajeshrs.in/blog/ai-explorations/2025-11-14-praval-agentic-ai-framework)

Key features: Built-in observability (OpenTelemetry), secure spores (end-to-end encryption), storage integrations (Qdrant, MinIO, Redis, PostgreSQL), and LLM orchestration.

### Vajra BM25 — High-Performance Search Engine

Fast BM25 search engine with category theory abstractions. Supports lexical, vector, and hybrid search with clean mathematical foundations.

- **PyPI:** [`pip install vajra-bm25`](https://pypi.org/project/vajra-bm25/)
- **Repo:** [github.com/aiexplorations/vajra_bm25](https://github.com/aiexplorations/vajra_bm25)

Features vectorized search for large corpora, native HNSW indexing, and Reciprocal Rank Fusion for hybrid retrieval.
