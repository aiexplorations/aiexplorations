# AI Explorations (aiexplorations)

Welcome!
This GitHub profile is the home of my open-source experiments and research projects around agentic AI, machine learning, search and information retrieval, and emergent dynamics in large language models.

## About Me

- Principal Research Focus: Multi-agent systems, mathematical foundations of AI, graphs, dynamical systems, and interpretable machine learning.
- I love building small, testable research codebases that bridge mathematical foundations to hands-on implementations—especially if it's agentic, compositional, or reveals deep or interesting dynamics.
- My background mixes AI, math, distributed systems, and software engineering from recent work experiences; and I always favor clarity, reproducibility, and simple well-documented demos.
- Past work experience includes mechanical engineering and aerospace design, manufacturing, quality management and statistical problem solving
- I've worked across industry domains such as automotive and truck manufacturing, telecommunications, renewable energy, and product SaaS (HR)

## Featured Projects

- **Praval — Multi-Agent AI Framework**  
  Pythonic framework for building collaborative multi-agent systems. Compose simple agents for emergent capability, with built-in conversation memory, inter-process protocol (“Spore”), and LLM adapters.
  - Highlights: agent decorator, tool use, composable API, multiple transport layers (RabbitMQ), memory integrations, code extensibility.
  - [Repo](https://github.com/aiexplorations/praval)

- **Praval Deep Research — Local-first AI Research Assistant**  
  Local-first research assistant for arXiv papers (runtime search, indexing, retrieval, agentic workflows and math parsing), built atop Praval.
  - [Repo](https://github.com/aiexplorations/praval_deep_research)

- **Vajra BM25**  
  Fast, vectorized BM25 search engine with category theory abstractions. Includes optimized index formats and parallel query engine.
  - PyPI: `vajra-bm25` (current version 0.2.1)
  - [Repo](https://github.com/aiexplorations/vajra_bm25)

- **Tlon Mathematics**  
  A Python library for mathematical process theory—where “processes” are primitive and “objects” emerge as stable patterns. Features dynamical systems demos (double pendulum, N-body, Keplerian motion).
  - [Repo](https://github.com/aiexplorations/tlon_math)

- **Agentic NLD — Chaos Theory in LLM Conversations**  
  Experiments with two-agent LLM conversations exhibiting chaotic signatures and sensitive dependence on initial conditions (discrete-time dynamical system for language).
  - [Repo](https://github.com/aiexplorations/agentic_nld)

## How I Work

- Most projects are Python-first (with some TypeScript, Shell, and TeX/PDF/Markdown documentation)
- I organize repos by research question and try to keep everything well-tested, simple, and reproducible.
- Contributions: Open to issues, PRs (prefer discussions first).

## Quick Start

General setup for any project:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"   # when available
pytest -v
```

Check each repo’s README for project-specific install/demos.

## Getting Involved

- Open to collaborations on agent-based AI, interpretable ML, mathematical frameworks, and high-performance search.
- For PRs, open an issue or discussion first; I value alignment and thoughtful reviews.
- MIT license by default; cite my work if you use it for research (I enjoy seeing derivatives).
