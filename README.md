## 🚀 What I Built Recently

- 🟠 **Praval:** [Praval](https://github.com/aiexplorations/praval) is a Pythonic Multi-Agent AI Framework. It lets you build intelligent agent ecosystems with decorator-based APIs, self-organizing, knowledge-first communication, and persistent LLM-powered memory. Praval’s philosophy: *“Simple agents, powerful results. Intelligence emerges from collaboration, not complexity.”*  
  - **Highlights:** Multi-LLM support, advanced semantic memory, production-ready infrastructure, and dramatic reduction in code complexity for agentic applications.
  - **See:** [Praval Guide](https://github.com/aiexplorations/praval/blob/main/praval.md)

- 🟣 **agentic_NLD:** [agentic_nld](https://github.com/aiexplorations/agentic_nld) explores Chaos Theory in Two-Agent LLM Conversations. This project provides a mathematical and empirical investigation of chaotic dynamics between large language models, including:  
  - A formal framework for chaos in multi-agent LLM dialogue  
  - Extensive Python and TeX-based experimental validation  
  - Reproducible tools for studying emergent complexity in conversational AI

- 🔭 **Production-ready AI applications:** From conversational AI (local, privacy-first chatbots and RAG systems like [Charcha](https://github.com/aiexplorations/charcha)) to AI-powered writing tools and knowledge graph miners.
- 📊 **EspressoInsights:** Actionable analytics and rapid visualization platform designed for intuitive business intelligence and effortless data exploration.
- 🤖 **ML and Deep Learning Apps:** Solutions using language models, vector search, and advanced NLP techniques.
- ⚙️ **System Design for ML Applications:** Expertise in requirements, sizing, performance, and scalable architectures.
- ☁️ **Cloud-Native Engineering:** Building and deploying on Azure and AWS, with DevOps, Docker, managed Kubernetes, and infrastructure-as-code.
- 🎨 **Creative & Visualization Tools:** Mac-native apps for style transfer ([Image Stylist](https://github.com/aiexplorations/image_stylist)), high-dimensional mathematical visualization, and experimental UIs.
- 🛠️ **Developer Productivity Tools:** IDE templates, scaffolds, rapid prototyping utilities, and workflow boosters like [Mac Shortcut Tips](https://github.com/aiexplorations/mac_shortcut_tips).
